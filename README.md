# ðŸŽ¯ Guess My Number!

In this project, i build an interactive number guessing game where a random number between 1 and 20 is generated each round, and the player tries to guess it by entering a number. The game gives immediate feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct, while keeping track of the playerâ€™s score that decreases with each wrong guess. When the player guesses correctly, the UI changes visually to celebrate the win and updates the highscore if the current score beats it. The game also handles edge cases like empty input and ends when the score reaches zero. A reset button allows the player to start a new game with a fresh random number and restored UI, practicing core JavaScript skills like DOM manipulation
